I am excited to start off my career in New York and utilize my learnings in Coursera in order to improve my skills in programming and analyzing. \n\nIn order to find the most suitable\napartment, the following paramters must be set in order to define the data points applicable.\n\n- apartment must have a minimum of 2 bedrooms\n- location must be within a 1.0 mile radius from any metro station\n- rental fee must not exceed $5,000\n- must be within numerous amenities such as food stalls, gym, restaurants, etc.   "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Business Problem:   \nThe challenge is to find an apartment for rent in NY that complies with the demands on location, price and venues. \n\n### Interested Audience\nI believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone planning to transfer into a large city."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

How the prices compare?\n- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Reference of venues around current residence in Singapore for comparison to Manhattan place"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Shenton Way, District 01, Singapore\naddress = 'Mccallum Street, Singapore'\n\ngeolocator = Nominatim()\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nlatitude = location.latitude\nlongitude = location.longitude\nprint('The geograpical coordinate of Singapore home are {}, {}.'.format(latitude, longitude))", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "neighborhood_latitude=1.2792655\nneighborhood_longitude=103.8480938", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# The code was removed by Watson Studio for sharing.", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "LIMIT = 100 # limit of number of venues returned by Foursquare API\nradius = 500 # define radius\n\n# create URL\nurl = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n    CLIENT_ID, \n    CLIENT_SECRET, \n    VERSION, \n    neighborhood_latitude, \n    neighborhood_longitude, \n    radius, \n    LIMIT)\nurl # display URL", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "results = requests.get(url).json()\n#results", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# function that extracts the category of the venue\ndef get_category_type(row):\n    try:\n        categories_list = row['categories']\n    except:\n        categories_list = row['venue.categories']\n        \n    if len(categories_list) == 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return categories_list[0]['name']", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "venues = results['response']['groups'][0]['items']\n    \nSGnearby_venues = json_normalize(venues) # flatten JSON\n\n# filter columns\nfiltered_columns = ['venue.name', 'venue.categories', 'venue.location.lat', 'venue.location.lng']\nSGnearby_venues =SGnearby_venues.loc[:, filtered_columns]\n\n# filter the category for each row\nSGnearby_venues['venue.categories'] = SGnearby_venues.apply(get_category_type, axis=1)\n\n# clean columns\nSGnearby_venues.columns = [col.split(\".\")[-1] for col in SGnearby_venues.columns]\n\nSGnearby_venues.head(10)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.8", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
