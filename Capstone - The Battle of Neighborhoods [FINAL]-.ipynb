A csv file was created which will be read in order to create a dataframe and its mapping. The csv file 'mh_neigh_data.csv'  has the following below data structure. The file will be directly read to the Jupiter Notebook for convenience and space savings. The clustering of neighborhoods and mapping will be shown however. An algorythm was used to determine the geodata from Nominatim . The actual algorythm coding may be shown in 'markdown' mode becasues it takes time to run. \n\n\n### 2.2 How the data will be used to solve the problem\nThe data will be used as follows:\nUse Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all Manhattan neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB)\nUse foursquare and geopy data to map the location of subway metro stations , separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to be able to identify the venues and ammenities near each metro station, or explore each subway location separately\nUse Foursquare and geopy data to map the location of rental places, in some form, linked to the subway locations.\ncreate a map that depicts, for instance, the average rental price per square ft, around a radious of 1.0 mile (1.6 km) around each subway station - or a similar metrics. I will be able to quickly point to the popups to know the relative price per subway area.\nAddresses from rental locations will be converted to geodata( lat, long) using Geopy-distance and Nominatim.\nData will be searched in open data sources if available, from real estate sites if open to reading, libraries or other government agencies such as Metro New York MTA, etc.\n\n### 2.3 Mapping of Data\nThe following maps were created to facilitate the analysis and the choice of the palace to live.\nManhattan map of Neighborhoods\nmanhattan subway metro locations\nManhattan map of places for rent\nManhattan map of clustered venues and neighborhoods\nCombined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations\nCombined maps of Manhattan rent places with subway locations and venues clusters"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\n## 3. Methodology section:\n\nThis section represents the main component of the report where the data is gathered, prepared for analysis. The tools described are used here and the Notebook cells indicates the execution of steps. \n\n### The analysis and the stragegy:\nThe strategy is based on mapping the above described data in section 2.0, in order to facilitate the choice of at least two candidate places for rent. The choice is made based on the demands imposed : location near a subway, rental price and similar venues to Singapore. This visual approach and maps with popups labels allow quick identification of  location, price and feature, thus  making the selection very easy. \n\nThe procesing of these DATA and its mapping will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n- what is the cost of available rental places that meet the demands?\n- what is the cost of rent around a mile radius from each subway metro station?\n- what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?\n- What is the distance from work place ( Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future rental home?\n- What are the venues of the two best places to live? How the prices compare?\n- How venues distribute among Manhattan neighborhoods and around metro stations?\n- Are there tradeoffs between size and price and location?\n- Any other interesting statistical data findings of the real estate and overall data."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#      METHODOLOY EXECUTION  - Mapping Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Current residence and venues in neighborhood"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Shenton Way, District 01, Singapore\naddress = 'Mccallum Street, Singapore'\ngeolocator = Nominatim()\nlocation = geolocator.geocode(address)\nlatitude = location.latitude\nlongitude = location.longitude\nprint('The geograpical coordinate of Singapore home are {}, {}.'.format(latitude, longitude))", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "neighborhood_latitude=1.2792655\nneighborhood_longitude=103.8480938", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Dial FourSquare to find venues around current residence in Singapore"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# @hidden_cell\nCLIENT_ID = 'DVCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxC0CFLF1T' # your Foursquare ID\nCLIENT_SECRET = '5NWAGyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyLFWL1' # your Foursquare Secret\nVERSION = '2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx5' # Foursquare API version\n\n#print('Your credentails:')\n#print('CLIENT_ID: ' + CLIENT_ID)\n#print('CLIENT_SECRET:' + CLIENT_SECRET)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "LIMIT = 100 # limit of number of venues returned by Foursquare API\nradius = 500 # define radius\n# create URL\nurl = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n    CLIENT_ID, \n    CLIENT_SECRET, \n    VERSION, \n    neighborhood_latitude, \n    neighborhood_longitude, \n    radius, \n    LIMIT)\nurl # display URL", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# results display is hidden for report simplification \nresults = requests.get(url).json()\n#results ", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "#### function that extracts the category of the venue - borrow from the Foursquare lab."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "def get_category_type(row):\n    try:\n        categories_list = row['categories']\n    except:\n        categories_list = row['venue.categories']\n        \n    if len(categories_list) == 0:\n        return None\n    else:\n        return categories_list[0]['name']", "execution_count": 8, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "venues = results['response']['groups'][0]['items']\nSGnearby_venues = json_normalize(venues) # flatten JSON\n# filter columns\nfiltered_columns = ['venue.name', 'venue.categories', 'venue.location.lat', 'venue.location.lng']\nSGnearby_venues =SGnearby_venues.loc[:, filtered_columns]\n# filter the category for each row\nSGnearby_venues['venue.categories'] = SGnearby_venues.apply(get_category_type, axis=1)\n# clean columns\nSGnearby_venues.columns = [col.split(\".\")[-1] for col in SGnearby_venues.columns]\n\nSGnearby_venues.shape", "execution_count": 9, "outputs": [{"data": {"text/plain": "(100, 4)"}, "execution_count": 9, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "execute_result"}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Venues near current Singapore residence place\nSGnearby_venues.head(10)", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Map of Singapore residence place with venues in Neighborhood - for reference"}, {"metadata": {"scrolled": true}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "latitude=1.2792655\nlongitude=103.8480938\n# create map of Singapore place  using latitude and longitude values\nmap_sg = folium.Map(location=[latitude, longitude], zoom_start=18)\n# add markers to map\nfor lat, lng, label in zip(SGnearby_venues['lat'], SGnearby_venues['lng'], SGnearby_venues['name']):\n    label = folium.Popup(label, parse_html=True)\n    folium.RegularPolygonMarker(\n        [lat, lng],\n        number_of_sides=30,\n        radius=7,\n        popup=label,\n        color='blue',\n        fill_color='#0f0f0f',\n        fill_opacity=0.6,\n    ).add_to(map_sg)  \n    \nmap_sg", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# MANHATTAN NEIGHBORHOODS - DATA AND MAPPING \n## Cluster neighborhood data was produced with Foursquare during course lab work.
